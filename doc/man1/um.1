.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]um\f[] helps you create and manage your own personal collection of
man pages.
These custom man pages are called um pages, though by default they look
exactly like man pages and are indeed viewed using the \f[B]man\f[]
utility.
You can record what you know about a command in an um page so that you
can refer back to it later without wading through all the information in
the offical man page for that command.
.PP
\f[B]um\f[] can be invoked on its own or in conjunction with a
subcommand.
Invoking \f[B]um\f[] on its own is equivalent to invoking \f[B]um
read\f[].
You must provide a \f[I]pagename\f[] argument that tells \f[B]um\f[]
which page you want to display.
.PP
For more information about the available subcommands, refer to the SEE
ALSO section below.
.SH OPTIONS

These options are accepted by \f[B]um\f[] when no subcommand is

known.
